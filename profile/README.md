## Official LulzBot 3D Printers GitHub Organization

We've got a mixture of things between here and GitLab at the moment. We'll slowly move more things over as time progresses.

**Cura LE 4.13** development is still done on Git**Lab**, however we're getting things prepped for our move up to **Cura LE 5.X** over here.

**Marlin 2.1** is now fully on Git**Hub**.

Most of our documentation and open source information regarding our **3D Printers** is still over on Git**Lab**.
