## Official LulzBot 3D Printers GitHub Organization

We've got a mixture of things between here and GitLab at the moment. We'll slowly move more things over as time progresses.
CuraLE 4.13 development is still done on GitLab, however we're getting things prepped for our move up to CuraLE 5.X over here.
Marlin 2.1 is now fully on GitHub
Most of our documentation and open source information regarding our printers is still over on GitLab.
